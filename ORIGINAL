- StagWare.FanControl/FanControl.cs:
  - var speeds = new float[this.fans.Length];
    This variable is never used

- StagWare.FanControl/FanControl.cs/Fan.cs:
  - GetCurrentSpeed()
    Maybe rename this to ReadCurrentSpeed / UpdateCurrentSpeed as it isn't
    just a simple property getter

  - CriticalTemperatureOffset < make this configurable?

  - Maybe delete requestedSpeeds and rely only on state inside Fan.cs

  - HandleCritialTemperature():
    Test on `if (critialMode.enabled)` can be dropped
    
- Core/StagWare.FanControl/TemperatureThresholdManager.cs:
  - ResetCurrentThreshold broken?
  - cpuTemperature -> temperature [do we really care if it is a CPU?]
      
# -----------------------------------
  - AutoSelectThreshold():
    Isn't it safer to begin with the *highest* fan speed? // is this realy the case?

  - AutoSelectThreshold:
    Isn't it better to directly jump to the next threshold instead of steps?
    - this is what I do.

  - If fan mode is not AUTO, AutoSelectThreshold is not called.
    Keeping track of the temperature through the ThresholdManager would make
    sense if we switched back to AUTO.
